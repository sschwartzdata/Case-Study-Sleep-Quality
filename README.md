# A Case Study of Sleep Quality from 2013 - 2016
This is a Case Study of sleep data from a friend. The goal is to anwer their specific questions about their sleep quality in the form of slides and supported with visualizations.


## Supporting Files Description
All of the SQL, R, and Python codes and files that were used in this analysis can be found in their respective project directories. 


## Skills Demonstrated
- Data cleaning using R and SQL
- Data manipulation using R
- Data visualization using R and Tableau
- Analysis reporting and recommendations documented in a Google Sheets

## Data 
The data was collected from a Basis B1 fitness tracker from 1/1/2013 to 10/31/2016.

### Data Limitations
The data was limited to the nights that the user wore the tracker. 
The sleep stage data feature was not available until after 1/17/2014. All analysis performed on the sleep stages are limited to the dates 1/18/2014 to 10/31/2016.


## Future work
I plan to come back to this project in the near future and demonstrate my ability to duplicate my data analysis using python and PostgreSQL instead of BigQuery and R.
